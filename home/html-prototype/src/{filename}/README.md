## Prototype Setup

This project does not have any dependencies other than the fact it must be accessible by a web browser. There are multiple ways of doing this, some common ones are:

```bash
# Using NodeJS
npx http-server src

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8080 -t src

# Using Python
python -m http.server --directory src 8080
```

If you'd prefer to use the quickstart NodeJS method using `http-server`, you can run one of these commands:

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn && yarn serve

# Using Npm
npm install && npm run serve
```
